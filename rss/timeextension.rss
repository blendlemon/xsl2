			<title>Feature: Let&#039;s Pour One Out For The Dreamcast&#039;s Best Controller</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>(Well, if you like fighting games, at least).</strong></p><p>When the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/guides/best-sega-dreamcast-games-of-all-time">Dreamcast</a> launched, I was fully invested in Sega's ecosystem. Sure, I'd flirted with the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/guides/best-ps1-games-of-all-time-playstation-titles-you-shouldnt-miss">PS1</a> and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/guides/best-n64-games-of-all-time">N64</a>, but the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/guides/best-sega-saturn-games-of-all-time">Saturn</a>—with its generous selection of 2D fighting games from Capcom and SNK—was my go-to system at that point. It was hopeful, then, that Sega's next system would continue this tradition, and the arrival of titles like <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/marvel_vs_capcom_2_new_age_of_heroes">Marvel vs. Capcom 2</a>, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/street_fighter_iii_3rd_strike_fight_for_the_future">Street Fighter III</a>, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/capcom_vs_snk_2_mark_of_the_millennium_2001">Capcom vs. SNK 2</a>, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/king_of_fighters_dream_match_1999">King of Fighters '99</a> and many, many more affirmed that.</p><p>There was one big problem—the standard Dreamcast controller was <em>terrible</em> for fighting games, at least compared to the legendary Saturn six-button pad.</p><p>Read the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/lets-pour-one-out-for-the-dreamcasts-best-controller">full article on timeextension.com</a></p>]]></description>

			<title>Capcom Is Keen To Make More Of Its Fighting Games Available On Modern Systems</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>"We want to offer an environment for you to play them".</strong></p><p>Capcom has been doing a pretty decent job of mining its back catalogue of one-on-one fighting games recently, having released <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection">Capcom Fighting Collection</a>, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a> and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a> in recent years.</p><p>In fact, the company has been so thorough in this process that there's a genuine fear that it has exhausted its enviable library of fighting games—and Japanese publication Famitsu felt compelled to discuss this with producer Shuhei Matsumoto, who recently worked on <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/ps5/street_fighter_6">Street Fighter 6</a> and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 (thanks, <a class="external" href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2025/may/03/capcom-older-fighting-games/">Event Hubs</a>).</p><p>Read the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/05/capcom-is-keen-to-make-more-of-its-fighting-games-available-on-modern-systems">full article on timeextension.com</a></p>]]></description>

			<title>Ex-PlayStation President Claims To Have &quot;Partly Saved&quot; Gran Turismo From Failure</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>"He gathered around thirty consumers to test the game [...] and they all crashed.".</strong></p><p>In <a class="external" href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version">a new interview with PlayStationInside</a>, the former PlayStation president Shuhei Yoshida has shared a story, in which he claims to have "partly saved" the original <strong><a class="external" href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/ps1/gran_turismo">Gran Turismo</a></strong> from failure by convincing its developers to tone down the handling of the realistic racing sim (thanks <a class="external" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shuhei-yoshida-says-he-partly-saved-gran-turismo-from-failure-by-convincing-its-creator-to-tame-the-handling/">VGC</a>!)</p><p>In the interview, which was published on PlayStationInside yesterday, the site's co-founders Geoffrey Lerch and Yacine Ouali asked Shuhei Yoshida about any achievements that he was particularly proud of during his career at Sony. This led Yoshida to get onto the topic of the 1997 racing game — a project he personally oversaw as an executive producer at Sony and one that he argues he played a small but significant role in giving important feedback on while it was still in development.</p><p>Read the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/05/ex-playstation-president-claims-to-have-partly-saved-gran-turismo-from-failure">full article on timeextension.com</a></p>]]></description>

			<title>New Dungeon Crawler &#039;Algolemeth&#039; To Feature Soundtrack From Streets Of Rage&#039;s Yuzo Koshiro</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Coming to Steam later this year.</strong></p><p>Yuzo Koshiro has been a busy man. Not only has he been hard at work recently finishing <strong>Earthion</strong>, his upcoming Mega Drive shmup (which is <a class="external" href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/05/yuzo-koshiros-earthion-confirmed-for-switch-ps4-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">also coming to PC &amp; consoles</a>), but he has also continued offering his services as a freelance composer, with the latest of these projects being a new dungeon RPG called <strong><a class="external" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731030/Algolemeth/">Algolemeth</a></strong>.</p><p>Created by independent developer <a class="external" href="https://x.com/gunzee2">@Gunzee2</a> (also known online as Medium-Rare Games), Algolemeth appears to be a brand new take on the classic dungeon-crawling experience, as seen in classic games like <strong>Wizardry</strong> and <strong>Ultima</strong>. However, in something of a contrast to those earlier titles, it will place a much greater emphasis on strategy and simulation, with the player acting in the role of an alchemist who has been tasked with creating the perfect team of AI golems to conquer the dungeon, defeat its enemies, and raid its riches.</p><p>Read the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/05/new-dungeon-crawler-algolemeth-to-feature-soundtrack-from-streets-of-rages-yuzo-koshiro">full article on timeextension.com</a></p>]]></description>
